# Autolist Lite
I used the following on the frontend:
 - React
 - Redux for state management
 - Redux-Saga for async calls
 - MaterialUI for design elements

And the following for the backend:
 - Express
 - MongoDB hosted on mLab

Plus some model tests in Mocha.

The frontend was initially scaffolded with create-react-app, and I believe only build dependencies are webpack-cli and Node (I'm using v. 7.7.2). 

## To run: 

 - `npm install` from project root
 - `npm start`
